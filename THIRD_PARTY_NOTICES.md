# Third-party notices

Blah is a new Swift application. Its dictation gestures and model choices follow
DK's Hex fork. Hex's MIT notice is included in LICENSE.

- Hex: https://github.com/kitlangton/Hex, copyright Christopher Langton, MIT.
- transcribe.cpp 0.1.3: https://github.com/handy-computer/transcribe.cpp, MIT.
- llama.cpp, source distributed in llama-cpp-sys-2 0.1.154:
  https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp, MIT.
- GGML, included by both runtimes: https://github.com/ggml-org/ggml, MIT.

Model weights are external files and are not included in the application:

- Parakeet Unified English Q8_0:

- S1-mini by Superwhisper Q4_K_M:

  S1-mini has its own model license. The settings identify Superwhisper.

The build downloads checksum-pinned native source archives. No Rust code is
compiled or included in Blah.

## Windows frontend and packaging

The Windows frontend bundles Python 3.13 (PSF license), Tcl/Tk (Tcl/Tk license),
sounddevice (MIT), PortAudio (MIT), pystray (LGPL-3.0), Pillow (HPND), cffi (MIT),
pycparser (BSD-3-Clause), and six (MIT). PyInstaller uses GPL-2.0-or-later with its
bootloader exception permitting distribution of the packaged application.

- Tcl/Tk: https://www.tcl-lang.org/software/tcltk/license.html
- sounddevice: https://github.com/spatialaudio/python-sounddevice
- PortAudio: https://www.portaudio.com/license.html
- pystray: https://github.com/moses-palmer/pystray
- Pillow: https://github.com/python-pillow/Pillow
- cffi: https://cffi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/license.html
- pycparser: https://github.com/eliben/pycparser
- six: https://github.com/benjaminp/six
- PyInstaller: https://pyinstaller.org/en/stable/license.html

Windows distributions include `THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES` with dependency license
texts and Python's license. The pystray source is available at the link above,
tag v0.19.5; it is an unmodified, separately importable module inside the packaged
Python archive. Recipients may replace it by running the supplied frontend source
with a modified pystray package and rebuilding with the provided spec/script.

MinGW builds may bundle its winpthreads runtime (MIT), MinGW-w64 runtime
(permissive notices), libgcc/libstdc++ (GCC Runtime Library Exception). MSVC builds
do not bundle those libraries. See https://www.mingw-w64.org/ and
https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gcc-exception-3.1.html. w64devkit itself is a build
tool and is not included in the app. Model weights remain external.
